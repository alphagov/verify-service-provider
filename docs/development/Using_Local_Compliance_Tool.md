## Run the Verify Service Provider against a local compliance tool

To run VSP against a locally running compliance tool you need to make a number of changes.

### ida-compliance-tool:
-> Add `hubExpectedToSignAuthnResponse: true` to configuration/local/compliance-tool.yml
(Currently sample-rp doesn't do this check but the VSP does so we need this signature in the VSP)

### verify-service-provider:
-> Copy `test-metadata-truststore.ts` from src/main/resources to the verify-service-provider root directory

-> Change verifyHubConfiguration section in configuration/verify-service-provider.yml to
```
verifyHubConfiguration:
  environment: COMPLIANCE_TOOL
  hubSsoLocation: http://localhost:50270/SAML2/SSO
  metadata:
    uri: https://localhost:55000/compliance-tool-local/metadata.xml
    expectedEntityId: https://local.signin.service.gov.uk
    jerseyClientConfiguration:
      tls:
        trustSelfSignedCertificates: true
```
The above will allow you to run the VSP against compliance tool locally if you configure (with POST request) it properly.

### To run service provider acceptance-tests:
-> Change `COMPLIANCE_TOOL_HOST` in AuthnRequestAcceptanceTest to `http://localhost:50270`

-> Change `HOST` in ComplianceToolService to `http://localhost:50270`

-> Either comment out the ```expectedEntityId``` assertion in ApplicationConfigurationFeatureTests or change it to use `https://local.sigin.service.gov.uk`
